# üïµÔ∏è Ethen Dixon

**`Developer, CG Artist, Security Analyst`**

I'm a full-stack developer at KnowMoreIT. Currently studying Computer Systems and Networking Technology, Computer Coding, and Computer Information Systems, I plan to obtain a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and a Master's in Computer Science. My passions include coding, ethical hacking, 3D animation in Blender, gaming, and reading. I specialize in Python, with some experience in CSHTML and C#, as well as ASP.NET Core and SQL servers. Ultimately, my goal is to work for the CIA and become an independent cybersecurity consultant. At just 17 years old, I have already completed a year of college, including five semesters in a Cisco Networking class. Let's connect and create something amazing!
